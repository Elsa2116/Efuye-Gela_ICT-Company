#  Front-End Development Internship @ Efuye Gela

Hello! I'm Elsa Alemayehu, and I'm excited to share that I've started my **Front-End Development Internship** at **Efuye Gela**. This repository will document my learning journey and weekly progress as I work on real-world projects.

##  About the Project

As part of my internship, I'm currently building a **Vlog Article** website. The goal of this project is to apply and grow my skills in a structured, sequential way â€” starting from the basics and gradually moving to advanced technologies.

##  Technologies & Weekly Progress

I'll be learning and implementing each stage week by week. Here's how my tech stack evolves:

### âœ… Week 1: HTML
- Structured the article layout with semantic tags
- Ensured proper accessibility and readability

### âœ… Week 2: CSS
- Styled the blog with modern, responsive design
- Used Flexbox and Grid to handle layout

### âœ… Week 3: JavaScript
- Added interactive features like form validation and dynamic comment display
- Practiced DOM manipulation and event handling

### ðŸ”œ Week 4+: React (In Progress)
- Migrating the project to use React components
- Managing state and props effectively

### ðŸ”œ Week 5+: Next.js and Beyond
- Plan to transition to Next.js for routing and performance
- Learn SSR (Server-Side Rendering) and API integration

## ðŸ“… Weekly Updates

I will continue to push updates regularly. Each week, I aim to:
- Add at least one new concept or feature
- Refactor previous code for optimization
- Reflect on what Iâ€™ve learned

## ðŸ“– Purpose

This project is more than just a technical exercise â€” it's a **learning log**, a **portfolio piece**, and a **real-world challenge**. By the end of my internship, I hope to:
- Build a fully functional, modern blog site
- Master the front-end stack
- Contribute to Efuye Gelaâ€™s goals with confidence



Thank you for checking out my journey. Stay tuned for weekly updates!
